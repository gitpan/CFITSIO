Hello again,

A new version of the Perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio
subroutine library is available. For more information on the cfitsio
subroutine library, see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio

New features in CFITSIO.pm 0.95 include:

* Added cfitsio 2.100 routines:
  fits_get_hduoff
  fits_read_pix
  fits_read_pixnull
  fits_write_pix
  fits_write_pixnull
  fits_read_subset

* Added old cfitsio routine:
  fits_get_keyname

Bugfixes in this release include:

* Reading TBIT columns with fits_read_col()/fits_read_colnull() now works.

* fits_get_hduaddr() (made obsolete with fits_get_hduoff() in cfitsio v2.100)
  now sets the output variables correctly.

* fits_test_expr() now sets the output variables correctly.

* fits_get_img_size() was causing a sigsegv and/or out-of-memory condition
  when called on a non-image HDU. The function now also automatically
  determines the number of axes in the image, accordingly the nlen argument
  has been removed from the Perl CFITSIO.pm API. This function also now
  always returns a Perl array, no matter what the current setting of
  PerlyUnpacking() happens to be.

* Fixed large memory leak reading into perl arrays.

Thanks go to Tim Conrow <tim@ipac.caltech.edu> for bug fixes and
implementations of some functions.

You will need version 2.100 of the cfitsio library in order to build
this module.

This module has been tested on Linux (2.2.x, ix86, glibc 2.1) and
Solaris 2.6 with perl 5.6.0 and perl 5.005, respectively.
