This is the final release of the CFITSIO.pm module, which has been replaced
by Astro::FITS::CFITSIO. This version warns the caller that they are using
an obsolete package, and aliases symbols in Astro::FITS::CFITSIO to the
CFITSIO namespace. As such, it requires Astro::FITS::CFITSIO.

Installation is the usual:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install
