1. Edit Makefile.PL, point LIBS and INC to the location of your CFITSIO
   library and include files.

2. perl Makefile.PL

3. make

4. make test

5. If you want, compare the output of the testprog/testprog*.pl scripts
   to CFITSIO's testprog.c. There is a small shell script (heresy!) -
   runtests - included to make this easier.

6. make install
