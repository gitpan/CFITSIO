Revision history for Perl extension CFITSIO.

      Mon Nov 23 1998
    - Added OO support:
      * changed fitsfile* typemap to T_PTROBJ
      * Added longname minus 'fits_' aliases to all functions which
        accept fitsfile* as first argument -  these aliases go into
        fitsfilePtr package.
      * Added functions CFITSIO::{open_file,create_file,create_template}
        which return fitsfilePtr objects.
      * testprog_OO.pl - parallels testprog.pl and testprog_longnames.pl
    - Namespace now governed by %EXPORT_TAGS{longnames,shortnames,constants}.
    - Put testprog*.pl in their own directory.
