Revision history for Perl extension CFITSIO.

0.90  Mon Dec 07 1998
    - Released

    - Haven't really been updating this thing for the last week, since
      so many changes are taking place. Did a complete audit of CFITSIO.xs,
      comparing it's implementation to the CFITSIO documentation and
      source code. This lead to wholesale behavioural changes and loads
      upon loads of bug fixes. Whoa be unto those who still use v0.50
      after this thing is released! Also made running, cmping and diffing
      of testprog/testprog*.pl much easier with testprog/runtests.
      Everything is in CVS now, making my dual development at home and
      work much easier. Oh yeah, did I mention the 137 new tests in test.pl?
      Finally, decided the next version will be 0.90

      Wed Dec 02 1998
    - More bug fixes, again mostly related to special cases of null pointers
      as input to CFITSIO routines.
    - Began work on test.pl. This is painful, especially given the four
      versions of testprog*.pl that alread exist...sigh.
    - Tried to split up CFITSIO.xs since recompiles were taking far
      too long. Unfortunately, xsubpp wants to make a bootstrap() for
      each of them.

      Mon Nov 30 1998
    - A bunch of (possible) bug fixes, too many to list individually.
      Mostly related to treatment of null pointers as input to CFITSIO
      routines.

      Thu Nov 26 1998
    - Finished testprog_pdl.pl, discovered that PDL uses the same
      array storage format as FORTRAN (row order).

      Tue Nov 24 1998
    - Incorporated Tim Jenness' fits_read_header()
    - Grammatical fixes in pod

0.50  Tue Nov 24 1998
    - Released

      Mon Nov 23 1998
    - Added OO support:
      * changed fitsfile* typemap to T_PTROBJ
      * Added longname minus 'fits_' aliases to all functions which
        accept fitsfile* as first argument -  these aliases go into
        fitsfilePtr package.
      * Added functions CFITSIO::{open_file,create_file,create_template}
        which return fitsfilePtr objects.
      * testprog_OO.pl - parallels testprog.pl and testprog_longnames.pl
    - Namespace now governed by %EXPORT_TAGS{longnames,shortnames,constants}.
    - Put testprog*.pl in their own directory.

      Fri Nov 20 1998
    - Finished short names, made testprog.pl use the short names.
      testprog_longnames.pl is the old version.

      Wed Nov 17 1998
    - Began support for short function names (slow going, it is).
    - Small tweak to testprog.pl.

0.10  Wed Nov 17 1998
    - Initial release.

0.01  Wed Nov  4 23:50:39 1998
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.18
